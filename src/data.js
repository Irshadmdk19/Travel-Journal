        description:"Gadaikallu is about 8km away from Belthangady. The public bus service runs frequently or you could hire a cab or even drive down in your own vehicle. What sets this trek apart from others is the climb. Rather than walk over twisted paths, the path here is made up of stone steps.It is easy trekking, but be careful , it will be slippery during monsoon. some spot might be difficult for beginners to climb since it is vertical climb."
